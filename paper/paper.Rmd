## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r read-data-all}
data <- fread(here("data", "clean", "all.csv"))
```

## Including Plots


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

\begin{equation}
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\exp(x)-1}{x} = 1
\end{equation}

Inline code example: `r data[, uniqueN(participant.code)]`
